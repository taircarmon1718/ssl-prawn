# MKP DATA CONFIGURATION FILE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This YAML file defines the dataset used for the Masked Keypoint
# Prediction (MKP) self-supervised learning stage.
#
# In MKP training:
#   • The MODEL sees *masked images* as input.
#   • The LABELS remain the original YOLO keypoint annotations.
#     (Even if a keypoint is masked visually, its true location is the
#      supervision signal the model must reconstruct.)
#
# NOTE:
#   This is NOT the dataset used for final prawn keypoint training.
#   For downstream training, you will use the original (unmasked)
#   data.yaml file again.
